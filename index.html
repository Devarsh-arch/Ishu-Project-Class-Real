            <h1>My Class</h1>
            <p>I am in 10th class, in takshashila group. Our class teacher is Ankita Ma'am. She takes our care very well and everyone likes her. Ankita Ma'am teaches us physics and she teaches us very well. My other subject teachers are: Sanskrit-Reeta mam, English-Meera mam, Gujarati-Meena mam, Maths-Monalisa mam, Computer-Anjali mam, Economics-Rajshree mam, History-Baijayanti mam, Geography- both Rajshree mam and Baijayanti mam, Biology-Leeta mam, Chemistry-Nandini mam. Our all teachers do their job perfectly and teaches us with perfection. From class 9, we have to choose whether to study hindi or sanskrit and i chose sanskrit. Therefore I study all the subjects except Hindi. And that's all I have got about my class. My class and teachers are SUPER AMAZING!</p>
